A broken bone... A morning wind... A runaway trip...
A lonely child... A naked sky... A shaking empty heart...

When I feel like I am losing many things I love... Relax!
That's the compensation yet to pay! Relax!
Can not waste my time to sit and cry in vain! Relax!
It's a perfect time to make a move!

Like singing in rain! Let's start it again!
Let's begin as one! Let's start it again!
Together we'll sing it loud! Let's start it again!
We all have to learn the pain! That's what it's meant to be...
Wow!
Find a tiny hope in the pounding heart!
Break on through the hard luck with our shaking arms!

A quiet sun... A stupid song... The scar on his face
A moving cloud ...A waving sound... An empty foolish heart

When I feel like I am nothing but a lonely fool! Relax!
Among the decisions that I've made! Relax!
Somehow I am still believing in myself! Relax!
It's a perfect time to learn to give!

Like singing in rain! Let's start it again!
Let's begin as one! Let's start it again!
Together we'll sing it loud! Let's start it again!
We all have to learn the pain! That's what it's meant to be...
Wow!
Find a tiny hope in the pounding heart!
Break on through the hard luck with our shaking arms!

Don't leave... Don't leave... Please believe...

Just like sing in a rain! Let's start it again!
Let's begin as one! Let's start it again!
Together we'll sing it loud! Let's start it again!
We all have to learn the pain! Let's start it again!
Let's start it again!
Let's start it again!
