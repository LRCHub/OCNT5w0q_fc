slow down in the alley
and i can get out
sometimes i would say it loud
but for now i pray

nobody know i'm falling down
why don't we start it again
and every thing is turning 'round
why don't we start it again
nobody even hear a sound
why don't we start it again
somebody save me i'm going down
why don't we start it again
again again again again
why don't we start it again
again again again again

one day or another
maybe sooner or later
nodoubt i'll work it out
but this time i say

nobody know i'm falling down
why don't we start it again
and every thing is turning 'round
why don't we start it again
nobody even hear a sound
why don't we start it again
somebody save me i'm going down
why don't we start it again
again again again again
why don't we start it again
again again again again
